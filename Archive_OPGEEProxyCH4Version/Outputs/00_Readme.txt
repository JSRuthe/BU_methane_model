Note that outputs Oil_3Tranche don't match what is recorded in "SLR_Coefficients_Oil"
I suspect that raw model outputs that were generated and recorded in "SLR_Coefficients_Oil" 
were overwritten by subsequent figure generation.

Note that SLR coefficients between model runs are very close.

I will stick to the model results that were recorded in SLR_Coefficients_Oil since these are the coefficients
currently being used by CARB.
